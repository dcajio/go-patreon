# go-patreon (WIP - not usable yet)

Interact with the Patreon API via OAuth.

```
go get github.com/dcajio/go-patreon
```

## OAuth functionality not included ##
There are plenty of OAuth libraries available for Go and given Go's
best-practices it would be best left for the user to decide which
package to use and how to implement.
